# TrafficDetection
Imagining we live in a 100% smart city, we attempted to detect traffic based on real-time data about the vehicles and road data. This way we aim to improve mobility in big cities. For this trial, we created fake data about Madrid.
This project was done by Camila Barbagallo, Paula García, Juan Gil de Gomez, Rocío González Lantero, Oriol Vall and Valeria Zaldivar.
